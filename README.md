## 📌 About The Project

**Tamkeen (تمكين)** is a web platform designed to empower people with special needs by connecting them with trusted associations and NGOs that offer specialized services — such as therapy sessions, psychological support, and rehabilitation programs.

Think of it as a service marketplace, but purpose-built for the special needs community:

- 🏥 **Associations** list the services they offer
- 🙋 **Clients** browse and request those services
- 🛡️ **Admins** verify that associations are legitimate before they go live

---

## ✨ Key Features

### For Clients (People with Special Needs)
- Browse available services offered by verified associations
- Request services directly through the platform
- Share success stories with the community

### For Associations / NGOs
- Register and submit official documents for verification
- List and manage offered services (therapy, counseling, etc.)
- Manage job listings related to their services

### For Admins
- Review and approve/reject association registration requests
- Verify uploaded official documents before granting access
- Manage all users, services, and success stories
- Full control via a dedicated admin dashboard
